# Destiny Vaults

[![Build Status](http://104.130.11.192:8080/buildStatus/icon?job=destiny_game_stats)](http://104.130.11.192:8080/job/destiny_game_stats/)

Used to see data available via the Bungie.net API for the game Destiny.  With 10/13/15 Destiny update you can no longer see all play vault items.  Commented out this code and moved to vault template.

Started to add tests to test.py

Copy config-example.py to config.py and put your Bungie.net API key.
